# Sales_Analysis

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales data to uncover insights and trends that can help improve business decisions and strategies. By leveraging SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for data visualization, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

## Tools

 For the project, Microsoft Excel, MySQL, & Power BI applications are used.

## Data Description

This dataset contain detailed information about sales, including specifics about the customers, quantities, pricing, dates, regions , products & categorization details.

## SQL Codes

SQL is utilized to query the sales database, extracting relevant data such as Unit Price, Quantity & product specifics. This data is then cleaned and aggregated to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in sales, such as peak sales times, Percentage sales by City & Category. SQL is  employed to query the sales database, retrieving data on individual seller transactions, sales volumes, and Total Revenue.

## SQL to Power BI

Connecting SQL Server to Power Bi is an essential step in leveraging the powerful data visualization capabilities of Power BI to analyze sales data stored in MySQL server. This connection allows for the seamless integration of robust data management with interactive reporting, provide valuable insights into Sales trend, product performance and customerâ€™s product preferences.
In summary, the integration of SQL Server with Power BI for sales analysis empowers businesses to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, driving better decision-making and enhancing overall business performance.

## Power BI (DAX)

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) is a formula expression language used in Analysis Services, Power BI, and Power Pivot in Excel. DAX formulas include functions, operators, and values to perform advanced calculations and queries on data in related tables and columns in tabular data models. In accordance with the demand, we have computed new measures and columns.

## Power BI (Reports)

Report 1:- This will provide a summary of the company's sales. The dashboard uses a number of measurements, columns, and filters. 

Report 2:- This will provide a summary of the product's performance at the time of sales; the dashboard has several filters and measurements.
